# ApartmentHunt

This is the final project for Software Systems. The design is very basic as css was not permitted to place the focus on functionality. The website allows the user to create an account, login, add friends as well as post. As an exercise in software systems, every script is written in a different language(c,python,perl) while data is simply stored in csv files.
A live version of the site is hosted on the McGill CS server here : http://cgi.cs.mcgill.ca/~hpurdi/ApartmentHunt/
